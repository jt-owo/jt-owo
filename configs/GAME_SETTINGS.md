## KF2 Field of View

**Important:** You can adjust the Field of View normally using the in-game slider in options, but you can increase it even further.

To increase the FoV beyond the maximum, navigate to `Documents\My Games\KillingFloor2\KFGame\Config` and open KFEngine.ini with a text editor of your choice.

Find the line: `AspectRatioAxisConstraint=AspectRatio_MaintainXFOV`
and replace with: `AspectRatioAxisConstraint=AspectRatio_MaintainYFOV`
